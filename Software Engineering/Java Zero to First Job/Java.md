## JVM - Java Virtual Machine

This program is written in C++ which is responsible for converting Byte code to machine specific code.

You compile your source code to java byte code --> you execute your byte code on JVM.

The JVM is used for both - translating byte code into machine language for a particular computer, and actually execute the corresponding machine-language instructions as well.

## JDK - Java Development Kit

JDK contains JVM and JRE PLUS all tools which are necessary for development of Java programs.

## JRE - Java Runtime Environment

JRE includes JVM in itself PLUS java binaries and classes which are needed to execute programs.

## Platform Independence
