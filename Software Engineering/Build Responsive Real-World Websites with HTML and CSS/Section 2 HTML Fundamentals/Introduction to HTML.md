HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage

HTML is a markup language that web developers use to **structure and describe the content of a webpage** (not a programming language).

HTML consists of **elements** that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc.

Web browsers understand HTML and **render HTML code as websites.**

**Element** -> [< opening tag >  content  < /closing tag >]

**Opening tag:** Name of the element, wrapped in < and >

**Content:** Content of the element, in this example text. But it might be another element (child element). Some elements have no content (e.g. "< img >").

**Closing Tag:** Same as opening tag, but with a /. When element has no content, it's omitted.
